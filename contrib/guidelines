Code Guidelines
===============
The following guidelines apply to all contributions. Pull requests which contain badly formatted code will not be
accepted so please ensure your code is formatted accordingly:

 * Tab-Only indentation (width: 8)
 * A whitespace in front of all parenthesis (for both calls and definitions)
 * Try to keep the indentation as low as possible (using return and continue statements to end methods/loops early on
 is recommended)
 * Statements should not be split into multiple lines (statements which become unreadable should be split into multiple
 steps)

IntelliJ users may use the `codeStyleSettings.xml` within the `contrib` directory.
